# oh-my-zsh-aws-mfa
oh-my-zsh plugin for AWS CLI MFA
based on [https://github.com/sweharris/aws-cli-mfa](https://github.com/sweharris/aws-cli-mfa)
support for passing totp as an argument added by [kt-caylent](https://github.com/kt-caylent)

## Install Oh-My-Zsh AWS MFA Plugin
1) ```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/joepjoosten/aws-cli-mfa-oh-my-zsh.git "$ZSH/custom/plugins/aws-mfa"```
2) enable it in plugins=(... aws-mfa) in your zshrc file
3) source ~/.zshrc

## Using Oh-My-Zsh AWS MFA Plugin
This plugin adds a new zsh alias, `aws-mfa`, this plugin has four ways you can use it:

1) Call `aws-mfa` with no arguments.  This will cause it to prompt you interactively for a TOTP code for your current active AWS_PROFILE.
2) Call `aws-mfa 123456` where **123456** is your 6-digit mfa code from your virtual MFA device (such as Google Authenticator, FreeOTP, etc)
3) Call `aws-mfa my-aws-profile` where **my-aws-profile** is the name of the AWS_PROFILE you want to mfa authenticate to.  It will prompt for TOTP as in case #1.
4) Call `aws-mfa my-aws-profile 123456` where **my-aws-profile** is the name of the AWS_PROFILE you want to mfa authenticate to and **123456** is your TOTP code.

Note: Options 3 and 4 only make sense if you don't have an AWS_PROFILE already defined.  The objective being to go from having no AWS_PROFILE defined to having mfa-authenticated STS temporary credentials in one command.  

Furthermore, if you are using the zsh plugin for aws and have set your profile using it's `asp` function, this will interfere with both options 3 and 4, because it will inject it's AWS_PROFILE information into all subshells, causing all requests to utilize the profile defined with `asp` rather than the argument you provide here.  You can correct for this by running `asp` with no arguments to unset the profile, and these setting will once again work as outlined above.
